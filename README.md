# mono-git-docker
Docker image based on mono with addition of git.

## Rationale

For using BitBucket Pipelines with my .NET projects with git submodules. I.e., as the BitBucket Pipelines do not support git submodules, I need a Docker image with git and mono.

## Docker

[tsvx/mono-git](https://hub.docker.com/r/tsvx/mono-git/)

## Caveat

This is my first Docker image.
